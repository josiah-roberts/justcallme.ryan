It's not just that I'm not going to see the future.
It's that everything gets deleted
Everything
Time stops
Everything that used to exist is erased
There's not even a memory of existance to hold to
Once you die, it's as if the entire universe never existed in the first place
Everything is consumed by non-being
That's the true horror of consciousness

Time is given meaning in as much as the present can refer back to the past. Without existance, the future history of the universe rushes past, incomprehensible. The universe dceays literally in effectively the same moment that the self does conceptually.


I woke up suddenly at about 1:00 AM last night. I don't know what woke me - no dreams or sounds that I can recall. What I do remember was the immediate, pressing thought on my mind, like waking up to someone's face inches from yours, staring into your eyes: "I'm going to die." No... more specific than that: "I'm going to die and no longer exist." And inescapable: "I'm going to die and no longer exist no matter what I do."

I sat on the side of my bed and muttered into the darkness, "fuck." And I did what I always do - waited for the immediacy to pass. My friends were still in the living room, trying to learn a new card game. I tell myself that I'm going to die, but tonight I'm still alive.

I'm not afraid of dying - that's just another event in a person's life. I'm afraid of being dead. I used to think this was a case of Fear Of Missing Out - the idea that death is scary because you will miss out on everything that happens after you're gone. Perhaps a fear of being forgotten. I've realized it's deeper than that.

When a person dies, they stop breathing. Their heart stops beating. Tissues become oxygen-starved. Gradually, the complex web of neurons that makes up a person's brain stops firing. They stop thinking, stop experiencing, stop _being_. For that person, where does that leave reality, when the matter that they were composed of is no longer doing the work of being them?

Everything falls apart. You are gone, of course. But without any consciousness to observe them, so is anyone in the room with you when you died. Your neighbor down the street. The president of the United States and all the starving children in Africa. For the person who has lost their being, everything goes with them. In the moment of death, all of existance is wiped clean. There are no people, no art, no love. The universe itself dissolves, leaving objects, no ideas, no logic. _No time._
