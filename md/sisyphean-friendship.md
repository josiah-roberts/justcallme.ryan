Luca left last week. He was moving in with a friend in the area - cheaper rent, better accommodations. When he walked out the door I sighed and turned to Derrick, "There goes another one." Derrick seemed a bit bemused, "He's still in the area - he'll be around for another five months." I shook my head. "No. He's gone."

Derrick is right of course - Luca will still be around. We could keep in touch. But I know we won't. Luca lived with us for a few months, became a casual friend, and now he's moving on. Our paths may cross again, but we're over the hill now: another boulder rolling down, another Sisyphean Friendship over.

I generally don't miss people. Even so, some departures hurt more than others. Take Karolina: I remember clearly sitting on the couch the first few evenings she was here – she would shyly putter around the kitchen, and then stand and watch in the doorway while we all talked in the living room. She worked a lot. We would mostly see her late at night – she wasn’t around for weekend outings, always at the lab.

We didn't spend much time together until the last few weeks Karolina was here. She would be there in the evenings while Kevin, Derrick and I were there, chatting or watching a show. I can see her sitting there on the end of the couch, hair up in a towel from her shower, hands wrapped around a mug of magnesium, listening.

 and we all decided  I'm glad she's back home, where she is happy, but I'm sad  People you appreciate on a level beyond the superficial, whose company you enjoyed more than that of a casual acquaintance. But gravity has no favorites... they roll down the hill just the same.

You can stay in touch, but it's not the same. I wish I didn't have to say goodbye - I suppose that's part of the appeal of the heaven that I grew up believing in - somewhere else we will go where we can reunite with the people we love, no matter how far separated by time, space, or circumstance. But that's not the hand we've been dealt.

This weekend, I'm in Santa Cruz, climbing that hill again.


One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

1. Reasonably strong, abrupt ending
2. Okay
3. Picture is good, but maybe in the wrong place. Poor opening.
4. Again, picture is good. Unify? What is this paragraph for?
5. Undeveloped
6. Undeveloped
Closing. Good material, Undeveloped
