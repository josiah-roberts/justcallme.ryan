I'm reminded of a scene in _Waiting for Godot_, as a weary Vladimir finally is finally faced with someone, a child, claiming to be sent by the Godot, but not the man himself. Godot won't be coming, at least not today - resolution will remain beyond reach.

"What am I to tell him sir?"

Was I sleeping, when the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tommorow, when I wake, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend I waited at this place, until the fall of night, for Godot? That Pozzo passed with his carrier and he spoke to us? ... Probably. But in all this, what truth will there be? He'll know nothing. He'll tell me about the blows he recieved, and I'll give him a carrot.

"What am I to tell Mr. Godot, sir?"

"Tell him... tell him you saw me and that... that you saw me." What more is there?


One can withstand an impact and still end up cracked.
    This happened to me
    (Maybe better to just say that, instead of abstracting?)
Being seen is important
    Not everyone seems capable of it
    Came from strange places
    It let me breathe out
    Did it help?
        I don't know
        I think so

I've always had this intuition that if you do the right thing, things will turn out well for you. Most likely another artifact of my upbringing, during which it was hammered into my head, "Good Guys always win." I realize this is very much not the case, but it is nonetheless an intuition that I've carried into adulthood.
- Discovering that you can do the right thing and just come away traumatized
- Should we then avoid trauma, or be cold-hearted?
- <break?>
- Regardless


I went into this with the stoic approach, believing that the satisfaction of doing what was right was sufficient. And it was - it got me through the most painful months of my life. What I didn't count on were the cracks. That the smell of <XYZ> would strike me months later with a tidal-wave of melancholy. The new fears.

I've learned that you can not break, and still be bent to the point of cracking, and sometimes what doesn't kill you makes you weaker. Slower to trust. Afraid of the future. Afraid of being left alone.

It's been important for me not to stuff things. Even now, coming up on a year after-the-fact, it still haunts me sometimes. A familiar place, person, or even just a smell, and I'm back there, in that moment. I remember exactly how it felt.


Doing the right thing is not enough. Strength in the moment does not translate to health long term necessarilly. Wounds need to be tended, and my friends helped me with that. It still bothers me, but I know it would be much worse without it.
