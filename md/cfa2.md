# Part I — The Beginning of Wisdom

<!-- I remember this sort of pervasive confidence permeating much of my family's social life.

The fundamentals of the religion that dominated our lives were such foregone conclusions that they needn't even be discussed: of course God was real, to believe otherwise would clearly require willful ignorance.

My mother and father were imminently respectable within our church; put together, an example to look up to, "spiritually mature." Our family was concerned with the finer points of Christianity, proper Christian parenting, the nuances of the doctrine of <x>. -->

I was a curious child; both fascinated by the strangeness of the world and a bit strange myself. I had so many questions about so many things that my mother began to keep a record in a spreadsheet of all the questions I had asked that she could not answer. How does that work, what is that for, where did this come from, and of course "why," why are things the way they are? That's why it is remarkable to me that I only remember a single example of a question about faith from my childhood: a conversation between my sisters and I, which went along the lines of "I can't imagine not believing in god, can you? How do people live like that?!" The question wasn't one of depravity, but of fortitude. To reject Christian belief would be to reject teleology, metaphysics, and eternal life. The unstated horror was a life with no purpose, and a death extinguishing existence -- to my sisters and I, a reality too horrible to even contemplate for more than a moment.

It was a mercy then that these questions came up so rarely, and only ever to marvel at those who could harbor such horrifying doubts. Despite questioning just about everything else, I grew up with a great deal of certainty around right and wrong, good and evil, the purpose of life, and the ultimate fate of my own existence. I don't believe that this was a matter of deception on the part of my parents, or others in my life. Rather, the entire community I grew up in was suspended in a sea of selective credulity, and we had no sensation of being wet.

My father's faith in particular leaves an impression in its unshakable nature: when he felt an impression that God was directing him, he almost invariably followed it. If things turned out well, it was evidence that God was guiding him; if they didn't, he felt an inner "witness" that he had done the right thing. On the rare occasions he disregarded these feelings and came to calamity, it was evidence that God had been warning him; if he disobeyed with no consequences, his conscience convicted him. My parents and our church's congregations would pray for the sick, and would take it as the Hand of God if they recovered. If the illness persisted, the response was to keep praying. When prayers were met with death, they moved on.

It should be obvious to the reader why this kind of thinking can only lead to one conclusion.

I accepted the certainty with which my parents held their beliefs into early adulthood, but I don't think I ever quite accepted their way of looking at the world, this willingness to accumulate faith by ignoring any evidence that did not confirm the belief they had already accepted. I don't mean to trivialize the reasons they believe; I understand where they are coming from, because I spent the first twenty years of my life there with them; I know what is at stake. The reality of belief is, for the truly devout at least, far from the caricatures that might be drawn.

Cancer starts off rather benignly. One of your cells mutates and fails to undergo the normal process of cell-death, continuing to reproduce beyond its normal life-span. Most of these cells are quickly mopped up by immune cells patrolling the body. Others manage to evade the immune system, but don't reproduce exponentially, and never become a serious issue for the body. However, sometimes a cell takes on a particularly nasty set of mutations: it multiplies out of control, and the new tumor signals nearby cells to form blood vessels, bringing additional nutrients. Most problematic of all, it begins to give off signals to the immune system, reprogramming the body's defenses to ignore the tumor. This is the sort of cancer that becomes malignant - that grows unchecked, taking over the entire body. The most advanced modern cancer therapies are all focused on getting the immune system to recognize the cancer for what it is, and to fight back again.

Cornerstone Church - the church I grew up in - has an alter-call at the end of each service. While the congregation bows their heads, the pastor gives an impassioned speech, and leads the church in a prayer of salvation. Everyone prays out loud - no distinction between members and visitors. Then the pastor follows up,

> Today, if you prayed that prayer and you meant it, I want to ask you to take one more step: on the count of 3, just raise your hand. Nobody looking around, just raise your hand. 1...2...3... Praise God, nobody looking around, I see you there. I see you. Thanks be to God. Amen...

> Now, everyone look up, now if you prayed that prayer, and raised your hand, we want to celebrate with you today. We want you to come down to the front, we just want to shake your hand, give you a bible, and give you some materials that will help you on your new walk with God. So on the count of 3, I just want you to come on down to the front, come on 1...2...3... Hallelujah.

People walked to the front of the congregation every week. Sometimes the same people. And they will tell you, "when I accepted Jesus, I was filled with this joy, I knew that my life was brand new, that Jesus had come into my heart." It's no wonder that evangelists have been using variants on this alter call since the First Great Awakening; it works. Humans are social creatures: if you put a person in an unfamiliar social environment, perform an impassioned initiation ritual, and then ceremonially accept them into your tribe, they will have a "spiritual" emotional experience. This experience provides a foundation of legitimacy for the conversion experience.

The initial conversion is followed by in-group policing, promises of paradise and threats of damnation. The convert is encouraged to dedicate their whole life to God, to put him first in everything, and they are exhorted that faith is crucial: failure to believe is itself a moral failing.

And so the immune system is reprogrammed. Believers are encouraged to spend their time with other believers, to "build up their faith." They are taught that God is the only true source of meaning and purpose in life. The belief becomes central to life, and as the years pass, the investment only grows. After a few years, for those who _truly_ "confess with \[their\] mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in \[their\] heart that God has raised Him from the dead," questioning such a belief is not only risking his soul, but also risks swinging an axe at the root of his entire life.

When regarding stakes like these, it becomes clearer why my family accepted anecdotes of faith and ignored unanswered prayers: to entertain doubts would have threatened our social network, our moral system, our source of meaning, and our entire way of making sense of the world. It would shatter the peace we had made with death, and it would render pointless and foolish everything we had built our lives on.

I'm speaking in the past tense for me -- for the family I grew up in -- but this is the present reality for all but me. I see it when our conversations go beyond the mundane. And it grieves me. I grieve when my father seeks out voices the encourage him to deny science. I grieve when my mother feels morally compelled to tell her son he is destined for hell. <!-- To be clear, it's not for myself that a grieve, but for her. Like the loves who never loved me back, my eternal soul is a thing that exists only in her mind, and though it never existed, I mourn with her its loss and the suffering that loss brings to her. --> I grieve when I see my sister flee from knowledge, fearing that seeking the truth will close doors of opportunity to her.

I'm not that special within my family: Katie is smarter. Jessica is more driven. Andrew is better with people. My mother is more responsible, and my father is a better leader. But what I have always had is a tenacious curiosity -- a dedication to the truth.

In the winter of 2013, I asked a question. I remember where I was. <!-- For the record - Christmas break, sitting with Katie staring into the fireplace late at night, talking. I think we had been discussing Courtney and Sam before/after. --> "What if I'm wrong? What if I die, and there is just nothing?" It was an uncomfortable thought, but I reasoned that if my beliefs were true they would withstand investigation, and I would emerge more certain. And for two years, that question tore me apart.

> _Wisdom cries out from the highest places of the city,_  
> _“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”_  
> _As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,_  
> _“Come, eat of my bread_  
> _And drink of the wine I have mixed._  
> _Forsake foolishness and live,_  
> _And go in the way of understanding._

<!-- In the spring of 2014, I sat under the plum trees and asked a question. "Why does anything exist at all?" -->

<!-- My parents are too far gone. If they were somehow to be operated on, I don't think they could go on without it. I have some hope for my brother and my sisters. They are all strong. -->

> "Estel, Estel!" she cried, and with that even as he took her hand and kissed it, he fell into sleep. Then a great beauty was revealed in him, so that all who after came there looked on him with wonder; for they saw the grace of his youth, and the valor of his manhood, and the wisdom and majesty of his age were all blended together. And long there he lay, an image of the splendour of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

> But Arwen went forth from the House, and the light of her eyes was quenched, and it seemed to her people that she had become cold and grey as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Then she said farewell to Eldarion, and to her daughters, and to all whom she had loved; and she went out from the city of Minas Tirith and passed away to the land of Lórien, and dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter came. Galadriel had passed away and Celeborn had also gone, and the land was silent.

> There at last when the mallorn-leaves were falling, but spring had not yet come, she laid herself to rest upon Cerin Amroth; and there is her green grave, until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten by the men that come after, and elanor and nimphredil bloom no more east of the sea.
