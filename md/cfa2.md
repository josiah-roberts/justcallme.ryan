# Part I — The Beginning of Wisdom

<!-- I remember this sort of pervasive confidence permeating much of my family's social life.

The fundamentals of the religion that dominated our lives were such foregone conclusions that they needn't even be discussed: of course God was real, to believe otherwise would clearly require willful ignorance.

My mother and father were imminently respectable within our church; put together, an example to look up to, "spiritually mature." Our family was concerned with the finer points of Christianity, proper Christian parenting, the nuances of the doctrine of <x>. -->

As a child, my only recollections of discussing God's existence were conversations between my siblings and I, along the lines of "I can't imagine not believing in god. How do non-Christians live with that?!"

I was born into a world of certainty, and came of age full of assurance. I knew God had created the world, and me in his image. I knew he had a plan for my life. I knew death had no sting.

# Part III — Undimmed Before the Breaking of the World

> _Wisdom cries out from the highest places of the city,_  
> _“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!”_  
> _As for him who lacks understanding, she says to him,_  
> _“Come, eat of my bread_  
> _And drink of the wine I have mixed._  
> _Forsake foolishness and live,_  
> _And go in the way of understanding._

> An image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory, undimmed before the breaking of the world.

_Outro_

> "Estel, Estel!" she cried, and with that even as he took her hand and kissed it, he fell into sleep. Then a great beauty was revealed in him, so that all who after came there looked on him with wonder; for they saw the grace of his youth, and the valor of his manhood, and the wisdom and majesty of his age were all blended together. And long there he lay, an image of the splendour of the Kings of Men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

> But Arwen went forth from the House, and the light of her eyes was quenched, and it seemed to her people that she had become cold and grey as nightfall in winter that comes without a star. Then she said farewell to Eldarion, and to her daughters, and to all whom she had loved; and she went out from the city of Minas Tirith and passed away to the land of Lórien, and dwelt there alone under the fading trees until winter came. Galadriel had passed away and Celeborn had also gone, and the land was silent.

> There at last when the mallorn-leaves were falling, but spring had not yet come, she laid herself to rest upon Cerin Amroth; and there is her green grave, until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten by the men that come after, and elanor and nimphredil bloom no more east of the sea.
