Last year was hard. One way to measure strength is to subject it to the extreme and see if it snaps - a'la "you don't know how strong you are until you are tested." The implication is, of course, that people have reserves of strength beyond what they imagine themselves to be capable of. I've found reality to be somewhat more complex.

The hammer hits the metal, sparks fly, you creak under the load. It's Eleven at the gateway, Shepard on the Citadel, Sam in Cirith Ungol. But you hold. You remain true. Somehow you win even though you lose.

And then... the adrenaline wears off. The metal cools from the blows. And you start to notice cracks that weren't there before. You find new fears. Melancholy unexpectedly transfixes at a the smell of spring. It turns out that it's one thing to do what you believe is right in the moment, and another to come back and reckon with ~~music-item track="Trauma" artist="N'to | Joachim Pastor" spotify="https://open.spotify.com/track/1tPRFD05l5FktbHf3qCzGe?si=9uANj4xLQUe6oyy0esBs0A"~~.

When it happened to me, it wasn't what I expected it would be like - who I expected it would be. There's the usual suspects, the friends I've talked to every day for the last six years. But the real pillars of strength were found elsewhere. Maybe it's because they're all going through their own problems, or just that I know about their problems. But I found little solace in them.

I found strength in people who decided they cared about me. People with a wealth of wisdom and empathy. Odd, because they're not typical friends. But they were there when I needed them - deep pools of clear water.
