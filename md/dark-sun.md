There aren't many constants in the Nigerien climate, but the dust blowing in from the Sahara is one of them. To live in Niger is to continually find yourself, your belongings, and your food covered in dust. The rainy season reduces this somewhat, but it never really goes away. Indoors or outdoors, it doesn't matter: if you wipe off a table in the morning, by lunchtime it will have a fine coating of grime.

While I was in Maradi, I noticed a peculiar side effect of all this natural smog: the sun does not set, so much as it goes out like a dimming lightbulb. As it approaches the horizon, light from the sun must travel through more and more dust in the air, its silhouette evaporating before it touches the ground.

Just before it disappears, it is possible (though perhaps inadvisable) to look directly at the sun, and appreciate its perfect sphere for a moment until it is snuffed out by the Sahara.
