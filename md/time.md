Two weeks ago I quit my job. My last day was pretty relaxing: coffee with a friend; lunch with senior managment; pack up, shut down. Around 4:00 pm, we headed out to play frisbee one last time -- ice cream afterward. Reminecence. Halting goodbyes.

It hit me harder than expected, a familiar feeling: _leaving_. Leaving somewhere I know, leaving work I've invested in, leaving friends I care for. Once again.

Why? [The clock.] The little hand sweeps around and drags hours in its wake; days accrete away and become months; months pile up into years. And we are drawn forward, _ceaselessly into the future._ The hand is inescapable, and still I run.

> How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit: the fear of death.
