I'm not musical. Music got left out of my somewhat unconventional schooling, and I haven't managed to pick it up on my own since then. Furthermore, music in my parents house was always a rather limited affair: if it wasn't explicitly Christian, we didn't listen to it. My earliest musical memories are Carman, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Micheal W. Smith. Nothing secular, nothing instramental beyond the odd Christmas album. As far as I was concerened growing up, there may as well have been only two genres of music: CCM and "Worship."

I started using Spotify during my freshman year in college. My "starred" playlist tells an interesting story: if arranged chronologically, I can use it to go back to a particular time in my life, and see the particular songs that I was listening to back then. First semester freshman year, I was discovering sound-tracks and enjoying TobyMac. In the spring, I discovered Mumford and Sons, OneRepublic, Lady Gaga and Fun, and that there was more to music than CCM.

There's more to that playlist than just a record of my shifting musical taste, though. If I stop and listen, pick a song and let it play, sometimes the clock rolls back. And I'm in that moment - I can see what I was doing, feel how I felt, remember who I was with...

> _Boom Boom Pow_  
> _I have a Western Civilization research paper due tomorrow. Actually, today. The sun is going to rise soon. I have a volume of Josephus's History of the Jewish Wars in front of me. I've been writing all night. I've been up so long I'm not tired anymore._

> _Radioactive_  
> _I'm driving down Greta road in Branson, Missouri. Just about to pass the Motel 6. It's hot. The A/C in my car doesn't work, so I have a wet towel wrapped around my head. Several bags sit in the passenger seat - sandwiches from Jimmy John's. They're supposed to be delivered, probably to Wyndam Resorts, and probably ten minutes ago. I'm stressed._

> _Glory And Gore_  
> _The sun has just gone down, and I've just stepped out of the BHC after a long day working in the basement on the school's new admissions software. I'm headed back to D4, my dorm, where I'll see my friends, and we'll all head to the dining hall together. I'm happy._

> _Not Afraid_  
> _Past 11 PM in the study cubes. I've just finished my physics homework, and Adam has been asking for help on his. I should be tackling my Greek homework, but I don't want to. I feel like I'm not making any progress, and the existential dread that's been keeping me awake recently isn't helping. I feel trapped._

Not every song produces such a clear picture, though. Some give a hazy impression (_~~music-item track="Contact" artist="Overwerk" youtube="https://youtu.be/JRneiRumUDo"~~ - Niamey_, _~~music-item track="Tommy's Theme" artist="Nigel Stanford" youtube="https://youtu.be/jjbiMXfe2NU" spotify="https://open.spotify.com/track/2Atzk0W2RHeZw2oIiaBubK?si=2nqc31kRS5e7lP-LSVJcLw" google="https://play.google.com/music/m/Tnucuomqu2rm7e2gckxkfexmoqm"~~ - King's Dominion_), and some give nothing at all. Certainly some of these songs never meant much of anything to me, but others _did_. I liked those songs. I listended to them a lot - in the car, at work, relaxing on the weekends. And they faded. Now they are just songs that I enjoy, more associated with the tens of listens since they first made an impression than the impression itself - and the events experienced alongside that first listen.

That's part of life. The past fades into distance. Things once felt strongly don't feel as meaningful anymore. We forget.

I should be okay with that. Let my songs be whatever they are going to be. But sometimes, I just can't. When the opening notes play, I stop the music. I skip the track. The moments somehow seared onto these particular songs are too dear to let them be faded into nothingness. So though I love these songs, I can't listen to them anymore. They are my "dead songs."

Maybe some day I'll be ready to forget the moments these songs carry. Until then, though I can't listen to them, I can still share them with you.
