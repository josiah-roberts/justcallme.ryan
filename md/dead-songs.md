I'm not a musician. That's something that got left out of my somewhat unconventional schooling, and it is not something that I ever picked up on my own. And music in my parents house was always a rather limited affair: if it wasn't explicitly Christian, we didn't listen to it. My earliest musical memories are Carman, Steven Curtis Chapman, and Micheal W. Smith. Nothing secular, nothing instramental beyond the odd Christmas album. As far as I was concerened growing up, there may as well have been two genres of music: CCM and "Worship."

I got Spotify in my freshman year in college. My "starred" playlist tells an interesting story: if arranged chronologically, I could use to go back to a particular time in my life, and see the particular songs that I was listening to back then. First semester freshman year, I was discovering sound-tracks and enjoying TobyMac. In the spring, I discovered Mumford and Sons, OneRepublic, Lady Gaga and Fun, and that there was more to music than CCM.

There's more to that playlist than just a record of my shifting musical taste, though.

> _I have a Western Civilization research paper due tomorrow. Actually, today. The sun is going to rise soon. I have a volume of Josephus's History of the Jewish Wars in front of me. I've been writing all night. I've been up so long I'm not tired anymore._

> _Radioactive_  
> _I'm driving down Greta road in Branson, Missouri. Just about to pass the Motel 6. It's hot. The A/C in my car doesn't work, so I have a wet towel wrapped around my head. Several bags sit in the passenger seat - sandwiches from Jimmy John's. They're supposed to be delivered, probably to Wyndam Resorts, and probably ten minutes ago. I'm stressed._

> _Glory And Gore_  
> _It's evening, and I've just stepped out of the BHC after a long day working in the basement on the school's new admissions software. I'm headed back to D4, my dorm, where I'll see my friends, and we'll all head to the dining hall together. I'm happy._

> _Not Afraid_  
> _It's evening in the study cubes. I've just finished my physics homework, and Adam has been asking for help on his. I should be tackling my Greek homework, but I don't want to. I feel like I'm not making any progress, and the existential dread that's been keeping me awake recently isn't helping. I feel trapped._
