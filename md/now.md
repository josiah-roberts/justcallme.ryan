When I was a child, I used to sit alone in my room and try to feel the moment. Touch the comforter on my bed, look at the bookcase across from me, and attempt to become fully aware of myself in that instant. I had to pick a particular book to stare at to make it more real, more specific: “Here I am, at this moment, staring at By The Great Horn Spoon. I am me. I am here. I am now. This is real.”

I’m interrupted by my Mother’s voice; it’s time for dinner. Broken from this reverie, everything snaps back; reality is normal. I’ve got to answer Mom before she yells again. It’s not time for dinner of course, she just needs someone to set the table. Siblings gather, eventually my father appears, always the last to the table. I’m in the kitchen washing dishes afterward when it strikes me: I’m not in my room.

How am I not in my room? The version of me that said, “I am here, I am now”, where has he disappeared to? He is gone, so well defined in my memory but now so far beyond my reach, forever staring at that spine and making out “By The Great Horn Spoon.”

I was fascinated by this reality, that I could find myself in an instant, only later to have that moment separated from myself. I would leave myself memories, little outposts in a brief “now” to look back on and remember that they are “now” no longer. I’m not walking along the path at Buffalo Point. I’m not driving south on Highway 65. I’m not sweating my way through a conference in Hong Kong. I’m not watching my shadow in a Niamey sunset. I’m not with her, riding our bikes back from that concert in the dark. So real when I said to myself, “this is now,” the person that was there exists now only in a memory.

_Tick. Tick. Tick. Tick._

Time is a relentless force, and its hold is absolute. When I grew older, I had to reckon with the darker sides of the membrane of time. We are but insects on the windshield of the present, speeding into the future, all of our nows destined to be past, all of our pasts destined to be erased in that final now: oblivion.

What can be said in the face of annihilation?

I tried to write this a few months ago, the day after I left my last job. My last day was pretty relaxing: coffee with a friend; lunch with senior management; pack up, shut down. Around 4:00 pm, we headed out to play frisbee one last time -- ice cream afterward. Reminiscence. Halting goodbyes. It hit me harder than expected, a familiar feeling: _leaving_. Leaving somewhere I know, leaving work I've invested in, leaving friends I care for. Once again. Driven by ratcheting ticking of that second-hand.

That little hand sweeps around and drags hours in its wake; days accrete away and become months; months pile up into years. We are drawn forward, _ceaselessly into the future_, and I have no answer to the inevitable end. All I have is now and the memories of the nows that came before. So I find myself living a life seeking ever another Great Perhaps, to slow down the days by filling them with nows worth remembering. Maybe then when that final now comes, I’ll be able to look back on the ones that came before and find that even though they will be erased, they were enough.

What can be said in the face of annihilation? Only, “I was here.”
