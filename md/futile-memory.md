I find myself frequently disappointed in humanity. Though not so much in individuals as in the human condition itself. One of the areas where I find our shortcomings particularly tragic is memory.

I think that personhood is an emergent phenomenon, the product of history, experience, attitudes, inclinations, skills, and most of all memories. We are not ourselves ten years ago, because we have grown and experienced life since then, and as a result we are different people now. We are made up in large part of our memories, and to lose them is to lose ourselves.

When I was reviewing my albums from Niger, these two photos in particular made me feel regret. I took them outside the village of Torodi in western Niger, after a long day traveling the countryside. My interpreter and I were waiting for the bus (rickety van) to take us back to Niamey, and these two girls were waiting for the same ride. We relaxed by the side of the road, talking, for at least an hour before the bus arrived and took us further west in the twilight.

The part of this story that brings me regret is that I don't remember these girls' names. I don't remember what we talked about. I don't even remember if we talked through my interpreter or if one or both of them spoke English. I have these photos to remind me that the conversation happened, that a meaningful exchange occurred that evening, but all the details have... decayed. That's just part of the human condition. A sad part of the human condition.

I consider their names a significant loss.
