The particular accusation concerned packages of Oreos. The kind you might get out of a vending machine - 6 cookies in a little foil pouch. Quiao¹ spoke to a group of ten or so circled in the small hotel room, sitting on beds or leaning against the walls. "It's clear that his heart isn't in the right place. We can all see that he is morally deficient - when he buys snacks, he doesn't share them." Those around the circle nodded their heads, the elder leader most of all. A murmured chorus of agreement. They turned to me; what did I have to say in response to my moral failings?

Quiao didn't speak in English, of course. I heard this bizarre character assassination on a delay, through a whispered translation by one of the few team members fluent in both Mandarin and English. In the meantime, the circle stared at me - some detached, some indignant, one or two with their heads turned away in shame. My sister sat there, face down, as if she was a doll whose joints had all been broken by being bent backward too many times.

Quiao's accusation wasn't very effective—he had never asked for any of my food, and had he asked I would've given him some gladly—but he was not alone. The more abstract critiques, from Cyrus or Sarah², were harder to engage with or respond to. What can you say when a team-member claims you see yourself as above them? When the next asserts that that you are selfish? When another calls you "prideful?" My protestations were met with a redoubling of criticism, the circle erupting with disapproval. How dare I deny my flaws, when my sins against the group were so clear?

By now, we were a few hours into the session. It was the third day.

During the previous two nights, sessions had stretched past midnight. We were seated in a circle of foldable chairs on the third floor of an empty building. We were hiding from the government, because our religious youth camp was not registered. I recall I was intensely exhausted from long days of teaching. But we had to stay up - it was very important that we have this "meeting." One by one, Sarah called on the young adults in our group to share—share a moral failing they saw in my sister's character; "please give her some useful feedback. She needs to learn." Sarah started, to make the assignment clear, "she is headstrong and disrespectful of authority. She needs to learn humility...."

I understood very little of these sessions, as they were conducted in Mandarin and I only heard translations of snippets. I just knew that something was very wrong. By the third day they had either exhausted their store of accusations against my sister, or more likely had concluded that she had been sufficiently crushed after hours of corporate criticism and denunciation. It was during the horror of watching my sister go through this that I learned I could voluntarily suppress my emotions entirely, feeling nothing. The ability scared me. On the third day their passion needed a new target, and they choose me.

The entire experience was disorienting. Everything came through an interpreter, and I found it hard to take Quiao's accusation seriously; I was a bad person because I hadn't volunteered to give snacks to him? But it was clear that the rest of the room was dead serious, as more and more abstract and severe accusations piled on. In hindsight it may have been better to lay down and accept guilt straight-away. This wasn't a conversation, after all - the conclusion had already been made. I was a selfish and prideful man; a traitor to the cause; it was only a matter of how much force would be required to get me to acquiesce.

I fought. The things they were saying did not reflect reality, did not make sense. Their assertions about the state of my heart were wrong. My resistance was met with the overwhelming force of a group of people who know that they have all the power. As the room erupted in disapproval, my sister looked up and slipped me a note. Tears were streaming down her face.

> *And may peace rain down from Heaven*  
> *Like little pieces of the sky*  
> *Little keepers of the promise*  
> *Falling on these souls this drought has dried*  
> *In His Blood and in His Body*  
> *In this Bread and in this Wine*  
> *Peace to you*  
> *Peace of Christ to you*

I don't know how long they went around their circle, but eventually they beat me into submission. I was selfish. I was prideful. I had been abhorrent. Yes these flaws were not merely with my actions, but in my soul itself. Yes it was true. I was a terrible person.

The next two weeks, we ran workshops in Fuyang (阜阳), then rural Sixian (泗县). We could not get out; we could not leave; we were trapped with these people and, shattered, had to go on pretending everything was fine. I went through these weeks in a daze, remembering almost nothing. Of Sixian, I see rows of corn, a walled courtyard, three story building in the back, sugar roasted peanuts, hauling buckets of water from a well, white-painted iron gate. Of Fuyang, I see nothing but any empty ballroom.

David³ would come to me during this period, and give me food - little bits of packaged snack cakes, candies he had gotten somewhere. He didn't say anything. Of everyone in the group, he alone hadn't brought accusations in the denunciation sessions; if I recall rightly, he didn't speak at all. By now, the rest of the group had adopted stances ranging between embarrassment at this awkward situation, to gloating in domination, depending on their disposition. All of them were standoffish. We were pariahs, but useful pariahs. And so we were made to continue teaching.

---

The ordeal didn't end dramatically; we simply survived to the last day. I imagine I'd question the reality of it all—wonder if everything truly happened—if it weren't for David. On the last day, after we had said our goodbyes at the station and walked away from the rest of the team, he followed us out. He said he was sorry—sorry for what they had done to us. That's how I know that it was real.
