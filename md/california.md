A month or so before I moved in California I reserved a bed for a month in an Airbnb in Palo Alto. I remember the night I arrived, driving north from LA, worried because it was past ten and I was supposed to have checked in by seven. I was starting work at my new job the next morning.

"Katy" had arranged my booking online, but apparently she wasn't home that night - in fact, she didn't live there at all any more. The people who were home introduced themselves as Kevin and Derrick. The lawn was uncut, and when I poked my head in the door I saw that the house was a bit messy. The dining room table looked like it had been converted into someone's personal office. But Derrick assured me that I was in the right place, so I thankfully fell into my allocated bunk and tried to get some sleep.

That night was a year ago this evening. I still live in that run-down house. I share it with as many as ten housemates, depending on the month. Every so often, someone new comes through that door, and I extend my hand and introduce myself,

> "Hello, I'm Josiah."

> "Ah, hello! Nick."
>> "Lukasz."  
>>> "I'm Max."  
>>>> "Oh hi, I'm Sneha."  
>>>>> "Hey, my name's Dahlia."  
>>>>>> "Hello, my name is Sebastian."  
>>>>>>> "Prateek - "pretty" with a K."
>>>>>>>> "Hello, I'm Allison."    
>>>>>>>>> "I'm Emiliano."  
>>>>>>>>>> "It's Melih."  
>>>>>>>>>>> "Hey, I'm Stephanie."  
>>>>>>>>>>>> "Karolina."  

_John, Alice, Sean, Jerry, Joe, Sarah, Max, Ben, Raissa..._ and there are more. Drifters, students, interns, academics, lawyers, entrepreneurs, engineers; More than I can count, more than I can remember.

Some passed through quietly - the ones whose names I cannot remember. Many left a deeper impression, some becoming friends, others companions, confidants. One became a lover.

All of them are gone.

I'm reminded of my road trip to California, just after I crossed the Nevada border and passed a sign saying, "Welcome to California." I'd been driving for a long time, and still had a long way to go. The sun was setting over the Mojave desert, and there was nothing good on the radio, so I pulled out my phone and put a song on...

> Welcome to the ~~music-item track="Hotel California" artist="Passenger" youtube="https://youtu.be/EG05-Y_C4EU" spotify="https://open.spotify.com/track/5nS9WEWYnbQDBAe81SHhDP?si=iRZdRVm1Sa6jqo4mYkzhqg"~~  
> Such a lovely place,  
> Such a lovely face.  
> Plenty of room at the Hotel California  
> Any time of year you can find it here  

Back then, the song was an evocative piece that woke me up a bit on a long drive to LA. Today, I feel it more personally: a stone tossed into a riverbed, feeling the current of people flowing by. They keep checking in and out of the Hotel California - I wonder when I'll leave.
