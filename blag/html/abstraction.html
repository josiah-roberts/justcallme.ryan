  <h3>Playing games</h3>
  <p>
    It's often said that programming computers is difficult due to the fact that
    they are, "very fast, but very stupid." This is generally true, but I don't
    think most non-programmers understand quite what kind of stupidity it is.
    Computers aren't just generally idiotic - in fact, they actually never make
    mistakes.* This foolishness is of a different sort, and the problem is one
    of abstraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a game children often play, where one person makes a statement, and
    the other responds with "why?", without end, typically until someone says,
    "I don't know" or "there is no reason."
  </p>
  <blockquote class="annoying-conversation">
    <p>"I want to go home." <em>Why?</em></p>
    <p>"Because I'm tired" <em>Why?</em></p>
    <p>"Because we've been walking for hours" <em>Why?</em> ...</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    This game points out something fundamental about language: there is a lot
    that goes unsaid, that is <em>assumed to be understood</em> whenever we
    communicate. But the "conversations" programmers have with computers tend to
    be more along the lines of giving instructions than making statements, so
    the game becomes The "How" Game. How well you play that game decides your
    skill as a programmer.
  </p>
  <h3>Be specific!</h3>
  <p>
    But how does a funny language game actually relate to computers? Well, let's
    explore another conversation, this time focused around "how" instead of
    "why." Say I'm sitting in a coffee shop with a rather robotic friend,
    furiously programming, too focused to be interrupted. We might have a
    conversation like this:
  </p>
  <blockquote class="annoying-conversation">
    <p>
      <strong>"</strong>Can you get me a latte?"
      <em>Sure. How do I do that?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>"</strong>Walk up to the counter, order a latte, pay for it, and
      bring it back." <em>Sure. How do I do that?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>"</strong>Stand up, turn toward the counter, note the locations of
      the tables and chairs, plan a path around them,
      <small
        >walk that path toward to the counter, speak the words 'Can I get a
        latte',
        <small
          >read the price on the board, hand the barista the money, wait for the
          latte,
          <small
            >pick up the latte, retrace your route to the table, and hand me the
            latte."</small
          ></small
        ></small
      >
      <em>Sure. How do I do that?</em>
    </p>
    ...
    <p>
      <strong>"</strong>Tense your core to lean forward slightly. Begin to
      straighten your legs while pushing back your chair..."
      <em>Sure. How do I do that?</em>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    As you can see, giving this level of detail is exhausting (and annoying!).
    When people talk to one another, we try to infer the unstated parts of the
    message, and use our own problem solving skills to find ways to fill in any
    gaps.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computers can't do this. They therefore have to be given instructions; not
    just on a high level, but down to the most minute details. In fact,
    computers cannot "send emails" or "open web pages" or "print documents" -
    these are all high-level, <em>abstract</em> ideas of tasks, and your
    computer's hardware doesn't even know what an "email" is.
  </p>
  <h3>So what can computers do?</h3>
  <p>
    The point at which the "how?" Questions stop for computers is actually the
    same as for humans: the hardware. For our friend in the coffee shop, once
    there is a signal traveling from her brain to her leg telling it to move,
    there is no more "how?" We've left the realm of concepts, and entered the
    realm of physical reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your computer operates in a similar manner. Certain, basic operations are
    implemented "in hardware", meaning there is dedicated, physical circuitry
    that "implements" those operations. Some examples are the common arithmetic
    operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When your
    computer receives a command to add two numbers, there is no more "how?" to
    be asked. Instead, the circuitry in the computer can directly perform the
    addition and determine the sum.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic operations of arithmetic, moving data around physical memory, and
    interfacing with other hardware (your screen, your network card, etc.) is
    <em>all</em> your computer can do. But that's still quite a lot! Let's take
    a real world example: finding the square root of a number.
  </p>

  <pre>
      let x = 50
      let guess = 1
      
      [adjust guess]
      guess = (x / guess + guess) / 2
      if |guess² - x| > 0.001 
        go to [adjust guess]
  </pre>
  <p>
    Awesome - now <span>guess</span> contains the square root of x, within an
    error of <= 0.001! Using addition, subtraction, division, multiplication,
    and absolute value, we've been able to create something new that didn't
    exist before - the square root. We also needed a few other things:
    allocation (creating variables), assignment (putting numbers into those
    variables), conditional branch, jump (skip to a different part of the
    program), and comparison. All of these operations are implemented in
    <em>hardware</em> - no "How?" needed.
  </p>
  <h3>A world without abstraction</h3>
  <p>
    Now that we know how to compute square roots, what if we wanted to use that
    in a larger problem. For instance, in a video game, we might have the x, y,
    and z coordinates of three different players, and want to know the distance
    between them. Bear with me while we see what that would look like:
  </p>
  <pre>
    [change this to capture the flag]

    let x₁,y₁,z₁ = 1, 2, 3
    let x₂,y₂,z₂ = 4, 5, 6
    let x₃,y₃,z₃ = 7, 8, 9

    let squareₐ = (x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²
    let sqrtₐ = 1
    
    [adjust sqrt₁]
    sqrt₁ = (square₁ / sqrt₁ + sqrt₁) / 2
    if |sqrt₁² - square₁| > 0.001 
      go to [adjust sqrt₁]

    let square₂ = (x₂ - x₃)² + (y₂ - y₃)² + (z₂ - z₃)²
    let sqrt₂ = 1
    
    [adjust sqrt₂]
    sqrt₂ = (square₂ / sqrt₂ + sqrt₂) / 2
    if |sqrt₂² - square₂| > 0.001 
      go to [adjust sqrt₂]

    let square₃ = (x₁ - x₃)² + (y₁ - y₃)² + (z₁ - z₃)²
    let sqrt₃ = 1
    
    [adjust sqrt₃]
    sqrt₃ = (square₃ / sqrt₃ + sqrt₃) / 2
    if |sqrt₃² - square₃| > 0.001 
      go to [adjust sqrt₃]

    let oneTwo, twoThree, threeOne = sqrt₁, sqrt₂, sqrt₃
</pre

  <p>
    Quite a mess too look at! Recall my attempt to explain the mechanics of
    getting me a latte - this is starting to look a bit like that. And imagine
    what will come next: predicting what the distance between players will be a
    second from now to minimize network lag, for instance. If we carry on like
    this, things will become unmanageable quickly, not only because of the
    amount of code, but also because every time I write that square root logic,
    I might make a mistake. And if we ever find a more performant way to
    calculate this, I'll have to update it in a hundred places.
  </p>
  <h3>Abstraction to the rescue</h3>
  <p>
    To avoid all the problems that arise from repeating ourselves, programmers
    follow the example of human language, and build abstractions. Remember how I
    initially assumed that my friend knew how to get a latte, and asked
    directly? Well now that we've written the logic for square root once, we can
    build an abstraction around it. Once we've done that, any time we need a
    square root, we can assume the computer now knows how to do that.
  </p>
  <pre>
  let sqrt = number =>
    let guess = 1
    [adjust guess]
    guess = (number / guess + guess) / 2
    if |guess² - number| > 0.001 
      go to [adjust sqrt]
    guess
  </pre>
  <p>
    Now we have an abstraction, in this case a <em>function</em>
    <span>sqrt</span> which takes a number and gives us back its square root.
    For instance, <span>sqrt(81.1)</span> is 9.005565... When we use this
    abstraction we don't have to worry about <em>how</em> this happens - it's
    handled by the code we wrote above - we just focus on <em>what</em> we want
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    While we're at it, let's make an abstraction for distance too:
  </p>
  <pre>
  [go back and factor this poorly]

  let 3dDistance = (x₁,y₁,z₁)(x₂,y₂,z₂) =>
    let hypotenuseSquared = (x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² + (z₂ - z₁)²
    sqrt(hypotenuseSquared)
  </pre>
  <p>
    Now that we have these abstractions, we no longer need to think about how to
    take a square root, or what the formula for 3d distance between points is.
    We've already done the work of defining those ideas, and our code becomes
    much simpler, less repetitive, and easier to understand.
  </p>
  <pre>
  let x₁,y₁,z₁ = 1, 2, 3
  let x₂,y₂,z₂ = 4, 5, 6
  let x₃,y₃,z₃ = 7, 8, 9

  let oneTwo = 3dDistance((x₁,y₁,z₁), (x₂,y₂,z₂))
  let twoThree = 3dDistance((x₂,y₂,z₂), (x₃,y₃,z₃))
  let threeOne = 3dDistance((x₃,y₃,z₃), (x₁,y₁,z₁))
  </pre>
